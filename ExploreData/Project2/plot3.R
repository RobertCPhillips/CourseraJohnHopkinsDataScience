#fips: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county
#SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)
#Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant
#Emissions: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons
#type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)
#year: The year of emissions recorded

Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
