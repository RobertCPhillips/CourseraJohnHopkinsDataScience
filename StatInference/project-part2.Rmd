##Problem Statement
Analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

###Question 1
Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 

```{r}
data(ToothGrowth)
head(ToothGrowth);unique(ToothGrowth$dose)
```

###Question 2
Provide a basic summary of the data.
```{r}
summary(ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ",])
summary(ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC",])
```

###Question 3
Use confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Use the techniques from class even if there's other approaches worth considering)

###Question 4
State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
